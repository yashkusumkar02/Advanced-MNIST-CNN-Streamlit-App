# ✨ Advanced Handwritten Digit Recognizer


<img width="1919" height="968" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9f29767-705c-4ebc-88cf-fdaeee6995c7" />


An interactive **web application** built with **Streamlit** and **TensorFlow/Keras** for recognizing handwritten digits (**0–9**).  
It features an **Advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the **MNIST dataset**, along with an **interactive drawing canvas** for real-time digit predictions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **🧠 Advanced CNN Architecture:**  
  Built using a deeper, VGG-like CNN structure achieving **>99% accuracy** on the MNIST digit recognition task.

- **🖊️ Real-Time Drawing:**  
  Integrates **streamlit-drawable-canvas** for drawing digits directly in the browser and getting instant predictions.

- **🧩 Robust Preprocessing:**  
  Uses **OpenCV (cv2)** to crop, center, and normalize drawings to the **28x28 MNIST format**, ensuring consistent predictions even for off-center digits.

- **🎞️ Animated UI:**  
  Features a modern **CSS animated gradient background**, creating a smooth, dynamic interface.

- **🎯 Confidence Threshold:**  
  Displays predictions only if the model confidence exceeds **85%**, filtering out ambiguous or unclear drawings.

## 🎨 Style and UI

The custom **CSS styling** provides a visually engaging and user-friendly interface.

### 💡 Highlights:
- **Animated Gradient Background:**  
  Implemented using `linear-gradient` and `@keyframes`, achieving a fluid, continuous background animation.

- **Enhanced Visibility:**  
  Custom light-colored controls ensure readability against the dark animated background.

## 🛠️ Setup and Installation

### ✅ Prerequisites

You must have **Python 3.8 – 3.11** installed.  
Using a **virtual environment** is highly recommended.

```bash
# 1. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # macOS/Linux
# .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

---

### ⚙️ 1. Install Dependencies

Install all required Python packages using `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 🧠 2. Train the Model

Run the training script to generate the model file (`mnist_cnn_model.h5`):

```bash
python train_model.py
```

> **Note:** Ensure that you have `mnist_train.csv` and `mnist_test.csv` locally before training.  
> Do **not** commit these dataset files to GitHub.

---

### 💻 3. Run the Application

Once the model file is generated, launch the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open automatically in your default browser at:  
👉 [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

---

## ☁️ Deployment (Streamlit Cloud)

This app is fully deployable on **Streamlit Cloud**.

Ensure the following files are pushed to your **public GitHub repository**:

```
app.py
mnist_cnn_model.h5
requirements.txt
style.css
README.md
```

Streamlit Cloud will automatically detect and deploy your app 🎉
